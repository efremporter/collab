# Collab Project

Collab is a platform that allows artists and musicians to collaborate and make music together. Producers can upload beats or sounds onto their profile, and other artists/producers can create their own versions, and post them underneath the original!

## Background and Overview
There's an entire community on YouTube regarding music production. Beat makers (producers) post their beats to YouTube, hoping that somebody will buy their beat and create a song with it. In an ideal world, this song would be a radio hit, and the producer would be a big-name in the music industry. The same is true for artists who browse YouTube for beats, hoping to find one that they can use to make a hit song. Both parties need a platform that will help them gain exposure. That's where Collab comes in.

Using collab, producers can:
- Post samples & beats, which artists or other producers can use in their own creation.
- Network with different artists who choose to use your beat
- Upvote/downvote versions of songs

Using collab, artists can:
- Access beats that would otherwise be available (often) by purchase only
- Post their version of a specific song on a producer's page
- Gain exposure to a producer's entire network of followers, once posting a song on that producer's page
- Upvote/downvote versions of songs
